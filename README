The TOLL code aims to implement the very large constant multiplications, which generally appear in cryptography, under the shift-adds architecture using adders/subtractors. 

It takes very large constants written in a text file as an input and generates the Verilog design files describing the shift-adds realization of these constants and the Verilog test-bench files as outputs.

More detail information can be found in its README file.
